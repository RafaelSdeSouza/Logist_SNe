Abstract:
    We report the creation of large and well-defined database that
    combines extensive new measurements and a literature search of 3876
    supernovae (SNe) and their 3679 host galaxies located in the sky area
    covered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 8 (DR8).
    This database should be much larger than previous ones, and should
    contain a homogenous set of global parameters of SN hosts, including
    morphological classifications and measures of nuclear activity.
    Identification of the host galaxy sample is 91% complete (with 3536
    SNe in 3340 hosts), of which the SDSS names of ~1100 anonymous hosts
    are listed for the first time. The morphological classification is
    available for 2104 host galaxies, including 73 (56) hosts in
    interacting (merging) systems. The total sample of host galaxies
    collects heliocentric redshifts for 3317 (~90%) galaxies. The g-band
    magnitudes, D_25_, b/a, and PA are available for 2030 hosts of the
    morphologically classified sample of galaxies. Nuclear activity
    measures are provided for 1189 host galaxies. We analyze and discuss
    many selection effects and biases that can significantly affect any
    future analysis of our sample. The creation of this large database
    will help to better understand how the different types of SNe are
    correlated with the properties of the nuclei and global physical
    parameters of the host galaxies, and minimize possible selection
    effects and errors that often arise when data are selected from
    different sources and catalogues.

Description:
    The measurements of apparent magnitudes, diameters (D_25_), axial
    ratios (b/a), and position angles (PA) of SN host galaxies were made
    using the images extracted from the SDSS g-band. For each host galaxy,
    we analyzed RGB images of the SDSS to accurately measure the position
    of its nucleus to provide the SDSS name. With these images, we also
    provide the host galaxy's morphological type, and note if it has a
    bar, a disturbed disk, and whether it is part of an interacting or
    merging system. In addition, the SDSS nuclear spectra were analyzed to
    diagnose the central power source of the galaxies. Special attention
    was paid to collect accurate data on the spectroscopic classes,
    coordinates, offsets of SNe, and heliocentric redshifts of the host
    galaxies.
